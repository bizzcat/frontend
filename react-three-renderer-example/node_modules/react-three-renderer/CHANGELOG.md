CHANGELOG
===========

## 2.1.0 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) )

### Breaking changes
- Lights
  - `<directionalLight>` and `<pointLight>` used to point to the origin by default, but from 2.1.0 they will look forward.
  If you would like to restore this behaviour you can do:
```jsx
  // initialisation
  origin = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);
  // and within render 
  <directionalLight ... lookAt={origin}/>
``` 

### Components
- Added `<lineSegments>` geometry descriptor ( #68 ) ( @Nopik )
- Lights
  - Fixed `<directionalLight>` and `<pointLight>` rotation updates ( #65, #73 )
  - Fixed shadow bugs for materials which did not declare a `side` property
- Fixed updating of all arrow/axis helper props ( #59, #72 )
- Allowing updating of geometry properties in subclasses for geometry ( #76 ) ( @jardakotesovec )

### Core
- Fixed compatibility with `react@~15.1.0`
- Fixed compatibility with `three@>=0.74.0 < 0.78.0`

## 2.0.1 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) )

### Core
- Adds CanvasRenderer fallback when WebGl support is not available #53
- Fixed crashes that happen when returning null from composite components
- Fixed crashes that happen when replacing composite components

### Testing
- Improved testing:
  - made faster and easier to debug

### Documentation
- Moved wiki files into repository to get rid of submodule

## 2.0.0 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v0.1.2...v2.0.0) )

### Core
- Should work with React 15 :sparkles:
  - This version should work with [`react@^15.0.0`](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/04/08/react-v15.0.1.html)
  - For `react@^0.14.7`, please install `react-three-renderer@^0`
  - This is because React is increasing separation between its core and `react-dom`, therefore
  the tricks used to make `react-three-renderer` needed to change as well.
- Lots of the core has been rewritten to stay in sync with React 15
  but that means there will probably be new bugs appearing.
- Convert to a proper version system
- Upgrade other npm packages

## 0.1.2 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2) )

### Components
- Add `<sprite/>` component ( #39 )
- Add `uniforms` property to [&lt;shaderMaterial&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/shaderMaterial) and [&lt;rawShaderMaterial&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/rawShaderMaterial) ( #36 ).
- Allow reordering of components within the `<resources>` component ( #40 )

### Documentation
- Improve [&lt;module&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/module) documentation ( Thanks @DelvarWorld )
- Improve commenting for materialDescriptorBase

## 0.1.1

### Fixes
- core
  - Fixed a bug which would crash when the return type from a composite component would change e.g.:
  ```jsx
  class Wrapper extends React.Component {
    static propTypes = {
      internal: React.PropTypes.bool,
      res: React.PropTypes.bool,
    };

    render() {
      if (this.props.internal) {
        return (<scene/>);
      }

      if (this.props.res) {
        return (<MyResources/>);
      }

      return (<MyScene/>);
    }
  }
  ```

### Tests
- Added tests for the above case

### Documentation
